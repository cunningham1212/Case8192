        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> Good morning Brendon, it’s May 29th. Partly cloudy with a high of 74 degrees. Your throatMic is recording worse audio than usual. I’ve scheduled an appointment to have it repaired today. As a heads up, I may not be able to hear you as clearly.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon [To Assistant]:</u> Ugh, can you push that to after finals?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> Sure, checking with your school when final projects end...sure, I’ve moved that to the day after finals.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> You have a news update.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Sam Times:</u> Good morning, this is Sam Times from NPR. Here’s the president’s speech from last night. The president said, quote. Let me be clear, the economy is stronger than ever. I know that your grandparents are almost certainly not farmers. Now, I know that you listening to me aren't drivers, doctors, stock traders or teachers. Make no mistake, whether you are able or unable to obtain a job today, we have made progress. We are so fortunate to live in a time post automation. Unlike any other time in American history, whether you are employable or not, I know that you can put food on the table. I know that you have the healthcare you need. GDP, the amount of jobs available and Average Salary are up. That is progress. That is so important to defend. That was an excerpt from President Garland's speech.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Like and repost, oh and could also coment: It’s so important that we put our differences aside. So called ‘Unemployable Rights Activists' and ‘Workers Rights Activists' get us nowhere.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> The auto is waiting for you outside.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> You’ve checked in 14 minutes early. Today, to finish up your Farewell Address Analysis unit, I have queued up the Farewell Address of Former President Barack Obama. As some context, he was the president from 2009-2017. I recommend room 306, it’s perfect for quiet independent study.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon [To Assistant]:</u> Wait wait, go back. Star that and comment, I like this line. Really relevant.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> Final projects are coming up soon, you should go over your profile.</p>
        <p style="color: #000">“Hey, my name is Brendon Pierce. Feel free to call me Burr. I’m the son of Adam Pierce -- Secretary of The Department of Unemployable Affairs and I’m interested in political science and rhetoric.”</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon [To Assistant]:</u> Meh, that's fine. Good enough.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> You’ve been matched! For your Final Project, reach out to Tonda Durr and Bethany Johnston. We think that they’ll be the perfect fit. Here are their profiles. According to the DFTB Act, you will have 24 hours to leave your group before it becomes binding.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Bethany Johnson:</u> My name is Bethany. You can just call me Beth. My interests are all over the map. I’m into everything from chemistry to community service. Also, I’m the daughter of the Lead Writing Curator for Worker’s Rights Daily</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Tonda here. In short, I’m an econ nerd, if your aggregate demand is to get in touch, do!</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Hey, your background looks really cool. Want to meet up in the courtyard tomorrow? I invited Beth too...but she hasn’t responded yet.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon [To Assistant]:</u> Respond: yeah, I see the invite. Thanks.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> I added lunch at 12 in the courtyard with Tonda and Beth to your calendar. Looks like you have an eventful day tomorrow.</p>
