        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u>  Good morning Brendon, it’s May 30th. Partly cloudy with a high of 82 degrees. As a heads up, you have lunch with Tonda and Bethany today at 12 in the courtyard.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Sam Times:</u> I’m Sam Times reporting from NPR. With the Dedicated Foundation and Thorough Background Act’s final project coming up, here’s some of the advice former winners are giving about this bill. The consensus is clear. Even with a moderate presidency, bipartisan bills are the thing to avoid this year. With the Workers Party’s rising, campaigns don't care. Investment and outreach from pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies is also strong. Stick with those for your finals for the optimal job placement opportunity.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> The auto is waiting for you outside.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> You’ve checked in 14 minutes early. Today, it’s time to start your final project. Tonda is already in the Student Center and Beth is on her way and will be here in 0 minutes.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Bethany Johnson:</u> Are you Brendon?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Oh, you’re Beth.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Bethany Johnson:</u> Yeah.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Yeah, I am really excited for this project.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Hey, are you guys Beth and Brendon?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Bethany Johnson:</u> Who do you think you are? As a tip, when you wear #### like that, turns out, people can tell that your parents don’t do #### all. I can’t believe you would be such a privileged little ####. You aren’t going to win ####.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> I’m assuming you’re going to pack up too? Look, we could just write some bill off some generic econ. research I can do. We’ll wrap it in your political rhetoric and, done. It's as simple as that.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> I guess that’ll work. Sounds simple enough. Ummm, sooo, out of pure curiousity, why don’t you publicly say you’re unemployable.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Wait, really? Ok, you know how I’m into econ? I swear this is relevant.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Yeah.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Well, 80% of my classes are econ.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon: </u> Wait, what? Is that even, possible? How are you still meeting the requirements?</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Yeah, I’m just taking...a few...more courses.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Huh, no kidding...Well, that’s certainly going to look great for when you apply to positions.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> You’d think. I’ll send you an interview I had to be the econ ambassador for teenagers in this administration. Um, take a listen to it, when you get a chance.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Uh, I...sure</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> I’ll catch you around, let me know what you think of that.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Will do.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> You have one pending notification from Tonda Durr. Would you like me to play it for you?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda [To Herself]:</u> You got this.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Good morning ma'am. Thank you so much for this opportunity.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> Great, good to see some energy so early in the morning. Give me a moment. Hey, so, let me just pull up your records, you shared them right?</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Yeah, they should be under ‘Durr’</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> Oh, I kept looking for Burr. Just a moment. Oh wow, an 83.7% focus in economics?</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Yeah.</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> That’s competitive. So, that means, given your course load, you’ll be graduating next year then...</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Does it say that? No, this is my last year.</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> Well then, that is very competitive. Very competitive. Did your parents push you to an econ focus?</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Nope, not at all. My parents are focused on what they do, I’m focused on economics!</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> What do your parents do?</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> I’m really focused on employement...</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> What do your parents do?”</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> They're... unemployable.</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> So you have no support or connections from family?</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Like I said, my family is really foced...</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> Answer my question.</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Not really.</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> Do you have ANY experience with economics outside of school?</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Well, that's reason I was applying for this...</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> Don’t Conway me. Answer the question.</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda:</u> Well..No</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Interviewer:</u> I think we're done here. Thank you for your time. I don't think you'll be a fit here.</p>
       <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon [To Assistant]:</u> Oh my god, record journal. I.....I...don’t know what to say... delete journal...Reply: Oh shit, we need to fix this.  At the very least we need to try.</p>
