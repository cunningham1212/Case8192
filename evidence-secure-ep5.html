        <h2 style="color: #000">Transcript</h2>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> Good morning, you have some news updates. You have a new comment from Bethany Johnson on your project. The comment is smiley face emoji, fire emoji. She attached the following link.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Sam Times:</u> I’m Sam Times reporting from NPR. 17 year old Bethany Johnson was detained Sunday morning for a suspected arson that threatened the lives of hundreds. The daughter of the Worker’s Party media supervisor Josten Johnson set fire to a unemployable housing complex in Northern New Jersey last night at 2am. Search analysts are scrambling to see how she was able to avoid being flagged as potentially dangerous. Bethany reportedly visited the area to do community service work beforehand and hid her searches in other chemistry searches relevant to her major. Search providers are now alerting customers that searches related to fire will be temporarily censored. The fire, which started in the main lobby of the building, burned the homes of more than 200 families. All of them have been displaced and dozens are hospitalized with smoke inhalation. Images of families covered in soot are currently trending with the hashtag #HobokenFire. In a social media post by Ms. Johnson she said. “The Unemployables already have taken enough from me and my family. They will take no more. It’s time I start to take back what’s mine.” She linked to a DFTBA Final Project. It was the project of the son of current Secretary of the Department Unemployable Affairs and an unemployable student. The bill, now known as the Unemployable Rights Act, would prevent discrimination based on one’s employment status and the employment status of one’s parents. It would also give the DUA more powers to investigate discrimination and mistreatment. Adam Pierce made a public statement this morning saying that he was “committed to serving the president”. The president, one hour later, announced that he would be supporting the bill. Despite this, the bill is still likely to fail. The URA is currently polling at 44.2% among likely voters, which is 17.9 points higher than algorithmically projected. The workers party pledged its commitment to kill the bill. When commenting about the case, the workers party spokesperson said: “While we support Ms. Johnson and her sentiments, we understand the action is illegal and regret any damage caused. Still, we hope this day is remembered as our story, the day we took what was ours.” More of this coming soon, stay tuned.
