        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> Good morning Brendon, it’s May 31st. Partly cloudy with a high of 78 degrees. You have some news updates.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Sam Times:</u> I’m Sam Times reporting for NPR. In national news, the portals for the two major venture capital firms TheFactory and HddnFigures have been down for more than 48 hours after a devastating Distributed Denial Of Service attack. All current evidence points to a group known as “The Unemployable Hacking Collective”. According to a post from the organization, the attack was a protest against companies using one’s unemployable status and the unemployable status of one’s parents to vet applicants. In a joint statement made by the companies, they said that they use all legal data possible in order to increase the quality of their investments.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u>Tonda shared a project with you called “The Unemployable Act”. A bill has been attached. She scheduled a meetup with you this morning to work on it.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u> Brendon [To Assistant]:</u> What time did she end up finishig that?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> She finished writing the bill at 3:52 AM.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u> Brendon [To Assistant]:</u> Oh my god, well I don't have to worry about her not being passionate about it.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> The auto is waiting for you outside.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> You’ve checked in 3 minutes early. Today, it’s time to start your DFTBA final project. Tonda is waiting for you outside the Student Center.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Hey Tonda!</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Hey, how’s it hanging?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Good, I saw you shared the project with me.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Yeah, I had a great idea. We could look at the economic effect of enumerating Unemployability and making a bill that way we would put it into law.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> So, like how the Civil Rights Act enumerated race?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> Exactly</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> I saw the name you put on the doc. We might want to try a better name…</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> I’ll leave that to you. So…. In general, it’ll grow the economy. We can expect more competition, more jobs.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> More jobs? But wait, what about automation?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> That’s how economics works Brendon…People are a resource, more access to better resources creates more opportunities for business. That makes jobs, lower costs, it equals more spending.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> If you could give me some numbers, that’d be really helpful, but people aren't just going to believe you.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> That's why you're here. I already have the facts, I just need people to accept ‘em.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> I’ve got an idea.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon [To Assisntant]:</u> Do I have any starred clips relevant to this bill?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> Here you go.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon [To Assisntant]:</u> How can I make this sound more bipartisan?  Search relevant bills.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Assistant:</u> I found a bill that matches. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) bill is a good match. Here is a speech made by one of its proponents.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> I ran the numbers. Very conservatively, it looks like this would create a job and a half on average per unemployable over the next 5 years with increased competition and demand. It could increase overall spending by at least 5%.</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Brendon:</u> Do you think we have a chance of something good actually coming out if this?</p>
        <p style="color: #000"><u>Tonda Durr:</u> We might as well take the shot while we have it.</p>
